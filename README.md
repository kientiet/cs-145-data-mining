## To reproduce our solutions:

**Step 0:**
Before you do anything, make sure to 'pip install -r requirements.txt" or "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"

### LOESS-SARIMA

Author: Zooey - best score on leaderboard:

1. Go into `zooey-arima` folder
2. Access `arima.ipynb` file
3. Click `Run All`
4. After it is done, the Jupyter Notebook will create a `arima-submission.csv` file

### XGBoost

Author: Ryan - 2nd best:

1. Go into `xgb-solution` folder
2. Access `xgb.ipynb` file
3. Click `Run All`
4. After it is done, the Jupyter Notebook will create a `Team2.csv` file

### LSTM and Heuristic Approach

Author: Kien

For LSTM:

1. Go into `kien-lstm` folder
2. Access `lstm.ipynb` file
3. Click `Run All`
4. After it is done, the Jupyter Notebook will create a `Team2.csv` file

For heuristic approach:

1. Go into `kien-heuristic` folder
2. Access `heuristic.ipynb` file
3. Click `Run All`
4. After it is done, the Jupyter Notebook will create a `Team2.csv` file

### LSTM

Author: Son Dang

1. Go into `sondang-lstm` folder
2. Make sure you have python 3.7 and Tensorflow 2.2.0
3. Run the command `python3 model-v2.py`
4. After it is done, `sondang_v1.csv` will be created.
